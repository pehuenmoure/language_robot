The source from where I obtained my sound clips included this text:

This folder contains sample Non-Linguitic Utterances that have been generated by Robin Read using custom software (NaoSqueak) as part of his PhD studies into Human-Robot Interaction at Plymouth University, UK.

Each sample is accompanied by a descriptor XML file, which allows it to be re-loaded into NaoSqueak allowing editing. The future plan is that NaoSqueak will be released as OpenSource software. For now this software is in a developmental state… 

These samples are free to use for all. There is one condition - should you use these samples, please reference the following paper:

Read, R. and Belpaeme, T. (2012) How to Use Non-Linguistic Utterances to Convey Emotion in Child-Robot Interaction. Proceedings of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI'12), Boston, MA, March 6th-8th 2012.
